<h2>FAQ</h2>
Q: How/why do you want to update this project?<br>
A: I thought â€“ why let this beautiful, perfect and safe project die? So I came up with this idea after a lot of reading and work.

Q: Is Linux really virus-proof?<br>
A: Mostly - Windows viruses do not affect it at all, and a Linux virus (very rare) can only do damage  if you manually give it permission to run.

Q: Can anything be done in Windows?<br>
A: Stop asking silly questions...
